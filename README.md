Initial layout done with help of walking skeleton.

Drafted out a to do list on paper, then as I had seen groups use it in their end of year presentations, I put it together on Trello. Breaking up the tasks and getting used to it as Iâ€™ll need it for teamwork. This helped a lot as I could actually see how much I already knew and let me play with the order of things and keep notes on what was working or where I needed to revise. 

Used a fair bit of the code I tested in the workshops, worked out better this week, less stressful and I could pinpoint what I needed to go back on then.
